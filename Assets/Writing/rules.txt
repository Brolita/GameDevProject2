dialogue rules:
	saved a dialogue.txt
	don't comment in quotes
	follow the ordering conversions
	at least one new line inbetween dialogues
	don't name scenes with character's names 
	
How to:

Start a day with 									<< 
Then give the scene name that will start the day	<< [scene name]
Then start a scene with the command					>> [scene name]
Immediately after that, on the next line put 		>> [background]
Then give the characters that start that day		>> Emily
and the sprite to start them with as well			>> sad
If a character is not in the initial scene			>> you
There entrance will be handled, so don't worry		>> normal
Start a dialogue by entering a number				0
Give a character name (only valid names are ok)		Emily
Give a sprite (will be loaded as Emily_sad.png)		sad
Here you may give a case							[case: Emily < 3]
Give a quote, it can be multiple lines				"you said something that made me sad...
but it will be displayed all at once				... so now I am sad"
Here you may give an action as a result of this		[Emily + 0]
Finally a destination to go to next					1
You can give another dialogue as well				[case: Emily > 2]
Each can have its own case, but make sure 			"Hey, that was kinda mean..."
theres a case for all possibilities					[Emily + 0]
Note the destination can be a scene					[other scene name]
end dialogues with at least one newline
to start the next scene, just redo the command		>> [other scene name]
but make sure to keep following the rules			>> [background]
I'd recommend using comments with #					0 # comments can go pretty much anywhere
You can use CRTL+F to find comments					Emily
Which will be helpful when something breaks			happy
By the way, don't comment on lines with quotes		"Don't comment after me" [#DONT DO THIS]
You also don't need to but cases and actions		game
go to the game by making the desintation game

notes:
 >> cases should be used for subtle differences, because they still use 
	the same sprite and come from the same dialogue, but can be used to 
	branch off if the player has a high enough score to do something
 >> actions can be + any number, but the cannot subtract (you could probably 
	get away will [Emily + -1] but I'm not %100 sure about that)
 >> the code can throw some errors at you if you do something wrong
	but don't rely on it too much, it really only catches small things
